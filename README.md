here is some modification on github, we will check if we will get it locally if we do a:
git remote update!

Yes it worked but you need to follow it with a: git pull!
in order to pull the updates.

in this case there were no conflicts so no merging problems and no need to call the meld tool for solving the resulted conflicts!
